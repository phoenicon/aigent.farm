# Aigent.Farm — Autonomous AI Agent + Memory + Real-World Data

Aigent.Farm** is a modular autonomous agent system built for Web3 + real-world data:  
It combines structured reasoning, persistent memory, real-world asset data, and modular tool-based actions to enable trustworthy AI-driven workflows — from farm analytics to tokenization to cross-platform agent orchestration.

---

## 🌟 Why Aigent.Farm Exists  

Most AI agents today are black-box, brittle, and disconnected from real assets or long-running state.  
Aigent.Farm bridges that gap, enabling:

- Transparent reasoning chains — you can inspect *why* the agent made a decision  
- Persistent memory/state via a decentralized memory layer — bridging sessions, users, and platforms  
- Real-world data integration (e.g. farmland, agricultural yields, ESG/asset metadata) to enable real-asset tracking, valuation, and analytics  
- Modular, tool-based actions — so it's easy to add new domains without rewriting the core  
- A foundation for real-world use — not just toy demos — useful in agriculture, finance, sustainability, and beyond

## 🚀 Key Features  

- **Structured Reasoning Chain** — step-by-step logic and decision process  
- **Action Engine & Tool Router** — clean modular actions (data fetch, compute, evaluation, tokenization, on-chain calls, etc.)  
- **Persistent Memory (via Unibase or chosen memory backend)** — state/root-context storage for long-running multi-step tasks  
- **Real-World Data Integration** — farmland records, crop/livestock yields, asset metadata, ESG data  
- **Flexible Architecture** — easily extensible with new modules (tokenization, valuation, domain-specific agents, analytics, RWA pipelines)  
- **Clear Demo / Deployment Path** — minimal dependencies, easy to deploy, test, and extend

- The agent reasons in clear steps.  
- Tools are modular: you can plug in data-fetchers, analytics modules, on-chain interaction modules, asset-valuation modules, etc.  
- Memory plus data ensures stateful reasoning and traceability.

Getting Started / Setup (Example)

> **Note:** Adjust for your preferred stack (e.g. backend, memory store, tool modules).  

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/phoenicon/aigent.farm.git
cd aigent.farm

# (Optional) create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (if any)
# e.g. pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure memory backend / API keys / data sources  
# Modify config file or environment variables as required

# Run agent in demo / interactive mode  
python run_agent.py  # or equivalent entrypoint

# (Optional) run tests / example scripts  
python examples/demo_env.py
