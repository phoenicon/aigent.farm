I'm proud to announce our submission to the DoraHacks AI Agent + RWA hackathon: Aigent.Farm, an autonomous AI agent designed to tackle the UK's farming liquidity crisis.

**The Problem:** With a 2026 inheritance tax shock looming, many UK farmers face the prospect of selling their land to remain solvent. Existing financial systems are too slow, opaque, and often inaccessible.

**Our Solution:** Aigent.Farm provides farmers with a powerful tool to unlock liquidity without selling their land. Built in under 48 hours, our transparent reasoning agent performs instant field valuations, enforces a 25% collateral safety rule, and mints real-world asset tokens (FarmNotes) on-chain. By using a multi-chain architecture (BNB, Hedera, Bitcoin) and a walletless, gas-sponsored execution pipeline, we've made this technology accessible to everyone, regardless of their crypto experience.

The core of our innovation is transparent logic. Every decision the AI makes is auditable, eliminating the "black box" problem and building trust with farmers and regulators alike. Our persistent memory engine, FarmFort, creates a digital twin of the farm, providing long-term intelligence and a complete history of stewardship for future generations.

We believe Aigent.Farm can empower farmers to secure their legacies and save their fields, not chase yields.

We would be honored to have your support. You can view our full submission and vote for us at the link below.
