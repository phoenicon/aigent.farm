### Aigent.Farm: 150-Word Project Summary

Aigent.Farm is an autonomous AI agent built to solve the UK's farming liquidity crisis. Faced with a 2026 inheritance tax shock, farmers need capital without selling their land. Existing systems are slow, opaque, and often predatory.

Our solution, built in <48 hours, is a transparent reasoning agent that performs instant field valuations, enforces a 25% collateral safety rule, and mints real-world asset tokens (FarmNotes) on-chain. It uses a multi-chain architecture (BNB, Hedera, Bitcoin) and a walletless, gas-sponsored execution pipeline, making it accessible to any farmer.

The core innovation is its transparent logic—every decision is auditable, eliminating the AI "black box" and building trust. The persistent FarmFort memory engine creates a digital twin of the farm for long-term intelligence. Aigent.Farm unlocks liquidity, secures legacies, and empowers farmers to save their fields, not chase yields. Vote for the future of autonomous land intelligence.
