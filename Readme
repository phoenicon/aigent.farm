# 🌾 Aigent.Farm — On-Farm AI With Memory  
**Save Fields. Not Chase Yields.**

Aigent.Farm introduces the world’s first *on-farm AI agent with persistent memory*.  
Each farm receives its own autonomous AI agent capable of observing, learning, valuing, and unlocking safe liquidity through the FarmNote token system — all built on Hedera and powered by UniBase agent memory.

---

## 🚜 1. Problem
Farms face rising costs, tightening regulations, unstable markets, and a lack of real-time intelligence.  
Value is trapped in land, with no safe mechanism for farmers to access liquidity without risking ownership.

---

## 🌱 2. Insight
A farm is a living system — soil, water, weather, livestock, operations.  
It produces thousands of data signals every day.  
With a persistent memory layer, an AI agent can learn a farm as deeply as a farmer does over decades.

---

## 🤖 3. What Is Aigent.Farm?
Aigent.Farm is an intelligent on-farm AI agent with:

- **UniBase persistent memory layer**  
- **FarmNote tokenisation** (ultra-safe 25% collateral rule)  
- **Hedera HCS valuation loop**  
- **Real-time analytics & insights**  
- **Self-contained farm identity and knowledge base**  

Each farm gets **one agent**, one identity, one evolving memory.

---

## 🔄 4. How It Works
1. Farm data enters the system — soil, weather, yields, livestock, operations.  
2. The agent processes and stores intelligence in **UniBase**.  
3. A continuous valuation model updates based on regenerative performance.  
4. All valuation checkpoints are logged to **Hedera HCS** for transparency.  
5. **FarmNote tokens** can be issued using the ultra-safe **25% collateral rule**.  
6. Farmers gain liquidity without risking their land.

## 🪙 5. FarmNote Token Lifecycle
**Token Creation → Collateral Lock → HCS Valuation → Liquidity Release → Market Circulation → Redemption**  
(See included diagram in `/assets/farmnote-lifecycle.png`)

FarmNote enables a new category:  
**Bitcoin-backed regenerative agriculture supported by real-world performance data.**

---

## 🧠 6. UniBase Memory Layer
A farm is not a single snapshot — it is time.  
UniBase provides:

- Long-term storage of farm activities  
- Structured retrieval for the agent  
- Behavioural pattern detection  
- Local + distributed AI memory  
- Multi-farm comparative intelligence  

This is the backbone of the Aigent.Farm intelligence model.
